This version if a fork of AuthMeReloaded version 3.1 with some changes:
* Removed some things (sessions, reload support, some translations, console filter, forceworldsonlogin, group switch)
* Fixed some sneaky bugs (properly remember player position, some NPEs, and some others)
* Optimized (cache all, async login check, remove unnecessary chunk loading and disk IO)
